# GetMailsToDocs
Search for mail address to extract those mail texts to Google Doc

It is common nowadays to receive some newsletter to mail box. Sometimes a newsletter contains really useful information and it seems inconvenient to have it in mails, as it is messy to find the information in just one look.

With this script, it is easy to retrieve the text of the mails into a google document and maintain your inbox cleaner. 

# How to use it
Substitute email address in the code with the address you are interested in. Also substitute the name 'NewsLetter' with the name of the sender address.
Once you do that, go to your https://script.google.com/home and create new script. Name it as you prefer and copy the code in it. You will have, in the first run of the script, to grant it access to your gmail account. If you are logged already, it will be straightforward.

# How to Debug
To see the traces of your program, after it ran (either there was any error or not), click in menu option View -> Log. There you will be able to see the calls to all methods used and traces from Logger. With that should be easier to debug any problems.
